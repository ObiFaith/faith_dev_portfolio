				<p>
					I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer with over 2 years of experience building responsive, production-ready web applications across frontend and backend systems.<br />I work with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, and Python (FastAPI) to design secure APIs, scalable microservices, and user-focused interfaces. My experience spans payment integrations (Paystack), distributed notification systems, AI-enhanced content platforms, and e-commerce applications.<br />Beyond building software, I care deeply about documentation, mentorship, and knowledge sharing. I’ve tutored and supported aspiring developers, led engineering teams in collaborative environments, and enjoy breaking down complex technical concepts into practical solutions.<br />I’m driven by a desire to build impactful products, contribute to meaningful teams, and continuously grow as an engineer while helping others grow along the way.
