						I'm <strong>Faith Obi</strong>, a passionate{' '}
						<strong>Frontend Web Developer</strong> based in{' '}
						<strong>Lagos, Nigeria.</strong>{' '}
					</span>
					<span>
						My expertise lies in{' '}
						<strong>
							JavaScript, React, NextJs, and Tailwind CSS,
						</strong>
						where I excel in creating visually appealing and
						responsive interfaces that elevate user experiences.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					I hold a <strong>B.Sc in Computer Science</strong> from the{' '}
					<strong>University of Nigeria, Nsukka,</strong> and during
					my academic journey, I interned at Chidono Limited as a
					Frontend Developer. There, I worked on{' '}
					<strong>ASP.NET projects</strong>, revamping existing
					websites to enhance both{' '}
					<strong>user interfaces (UI)</strong> and{' '}
					<strong>user experiences (UX)</strong>. This hands-on
					experience solidified my passion for frontend development
					and sharpened my skills in delivering seamless digital
					experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to my professional work, I am deeply committed
					to giving back to the tech community. I{' '}
					<strong>mentor aspiring developers</strong>, guiding them
					through the challenges of the tech world and empowering them
					through knowledge sharing. I strongly believe in{' '}
					<strong>
						the power of community and the value of continuous
						learning.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in{' '}
					<strong>
						self-development and business books, watching
						documentaries or crime movies, or enjoying a game of
						table tennis.
					</strong>{' '}
					These hobbies help me maintain a balanced life, keeping me
					refreshed and motivated in my work.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm always{' '}
					<strong>looking forward to the next challenge</strong>
					â€”whether it's improving a product, mentoring someone new, or
					just exploring new technologies.{' '}
					<strong>Let's build amazing product together!</strong>
